# Welcome to Job Openings üåü

We're thrilled that you want to help us keep this job openings resource up-to-date! Whether you're adding new job listings or updating existing ones, here's how you can contribute:

## Adding a Job Opening

If you've got the scoop on a fantastic job or internship, follow these friendly steps:

1. **Fork This Repository**: Click the "Fork" button in the top right corner to make your own copy on GitHub.

2. **Clone Your Copy**: Use Git to bring your forked repository to your computer:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/job-openings
    ```

3. **Find the Right Spot**: Open the README.md file and find the section that matches the graduation year of the job you're adding. We've organized everything neatly!

4. **Add the Job Listing**:

    - For regular jobs, add a row to the table under the relevant graduation year.
    - For international jobs, do the same but specify the country.

    - Here's the format:
    ```bash
    | [Company A](LinkA)        | - Location A    | üåè Country A| ‚úÖ [Job Title A](LinkA)                 | üìÖ Date Posted A   |
    ```

    ***Replace the placeholders with the real deal.***

5. **Use Emojis**: Express whether the job is open or closed using emojis:

    - ‚úÖ for open positions
    - ‚ùå for closed positions
6. **Commit and Push Your Changes**: Tell Git you've made changes, give them a friendly name, and send them to your GitHub copy:

    ```bash
    git add README.md
    git commit -m "Added [Job Title] at [Company Name] - [Grad Year]"
    git push origin main
    ```
7. **Create a Pull Request**: On GitHub, go to your repository, and click the "New Pull Request" button. Compare your changes and share the love by submitting the pull request.

## Updating or Closing a Job Opening
If you want to freshen up job details or let everyone know a job is no longer available, here's how to do it:

1. **Fork This Repository**: If you haven't already, fork the repository (you're a pro by now).

2. **Clone Your Copy**: Clone your forked repository to your local machine (if it's not already there).

3. **Spot the Job Listing**: Open README.md and find the job opening you want to update or close.

4. **Update or Close the Job Opening**:

    For updates, give the row a makeover in the table.
    ***To close a job, change ‚úÖ to ‚ùå.***

5. **Commit and Push Changes**: Let Git know what's going on, provide a friendly message, and share your changes:

    ```bash
    git add README.md
    git commit -m "Updated [Job Title] at [Company Name] - [Grad Year]"
    git push origin main
    ```
6. **Create a Pull Request**: Back on GitHub, go to your repository, and hit the "New Pull Request" button. Compare changes and send the pull request on its merry way.
